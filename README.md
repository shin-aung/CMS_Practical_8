**Assignment 3 Version 2**
**Learning Journal: Enhancing James Cook University Open House Website**

**Learning Activities & Resources**

In advancing the James Cook University Open House website, I transitioned from the foundational setup to content integration. Leveraging the established platforms—Trello, Slack, and GitHub—I directed my focus toward infusing the website template with meaningful content.

Exploring online tutorials and guides, I familiarized myself with content creation and embedding processes. This phase involved collaborative efforts with team members to ensure a cohesive blend of design and informative elements.

**Progress and Transformation**

Version 2 marks a significant evolution from the initial template. It introduces a spectrum of courses, blogs, contact information, and an informative section about James Cook University. The website now embodies a tangible improvement in richness and depth.

Collaboration within the team facilitated the integration of diverse content seamlessly. This iterative process allowed us to refine the user interface, ensuring an engaging and informative experience for prospective visitors.
